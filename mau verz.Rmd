### 1. Objective
The goal is the estimation of the yield anomaly of almonds based on the average minimum temperature of February, and the average precipitation  of January. We employ the following regression model proposed by Lobell et al. (2006):

$$Y = -0.015T_2n -0.0046T_2n^2-0.07p_1+0.0043p_1,2^2+0.28
$$

<br>
- Y: yield anomaly (ton/acr). <br>
- Tn: minimum temperature (Celsius). <br>
- P: precipitation (mm). <br>

The **Appendix** has the R source code for almond anomaly yield function.

### 2. Dataframe format
The dataframe requires daily data about minimum temperature (Celsius), and precipitations (mm). We display all the details for dataset management below:

```{r}
# 2. Dataframe format
#
#' Dataframe requires the following columns: date, day, month, year, 
#' daily precipitations,and daily minimum temperature
#' The columns must be named exactly: day, month, year, tmin_c, and precip 
#' The variable units are Celsius (tmin_c) and mm (precip)
#
# Read in data
climate_df <- read.delim(here('clim.txt'), sep = " ")
```

### 3. Results and analysis
We run the model for period 1988-2010, because the monthly data was available for those years.

```{r}
# 3.1 We call our almond model
source(here("almond_anomaly.R"))

# 3.2We run for the specific dataset, named climate_df
# The parameters are the default ones
yield_anomalies <- almond_anomaly(climate_df)

# summarize yearly yield anomalies with line plot, address outlier
yield_anomalies_no_out <- yield_anomalies %>% 
  filter(year != 1995)

yield_anomalies_1995 <-  yield_anomalies %>% 
  filter(year == 1995)

# We construct our graph plot indicating the oulier
yield_plot <- ggplot(data = yield_anomalies_no_out, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(data = yield_anomalies_1995)+ # outlier point
  annotate("text", label = "outlier result for year 1995", x = 1997, y = 1750)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "year", 
       y = "Yield anomaly (tons/acre)",
       title = "Almond yield anomaly by year (1989 - 2010)")

yield_plot # graph

```

This graph depicts the estimated yield anomalies for almonds produced between the years 1989 to 2010 based on a simple regression model that uses the average precipitation in January and the minimum temperature in February for each year as inputs. The year 1995 indicated as an outlier since it differs considerably from the rest of the results. Notice that, generally, anomalies have become more extreme in recent years. We suspect the leading cause for the anomaly increase is climate change. We recommend implementing adaptative measures for this crop.
